# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This is a mysql employee database that allows the user to view and edit employees.

## Installation
This application does not have a user interface so before usage the user must have/ install Node.js , mysql2 , and console.table aswell as inquirer.
The first step I took to making this application was to make the initial prompts along with a switch case to make to make the foundation of the application. After making the initial prompts I then made the data bases that the application uses. After making the data bases I made the other prompts for viewing and adding/ altering employees.
